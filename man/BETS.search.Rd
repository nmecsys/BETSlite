\title{Search for a Brazilian Economic Time Series}
\usage{
BETS.search(description = "*", src, periodicity, unit, code, start,
  view = TRUE, lang = "en")
}
\arguments{
\item{description}{A \code{character}. A search string to look for matching series descriptions. Check the syntax rules under the 'Details' section for better performance.}

\item{src}{A \code{character}. The source of the series. See the 'Details' section for a list of the available sources.}

\item{periodicity}{A \code{character}. The periodicity of the series. See the 'Details' section for a list of possible values.}

\item{unit}{A \code{character}. The unit of measurement of the data. See the 'Details' section for a list of possible values.}

\item{code}{An \code{integer}. The index of the series within the database.}

\item{start}{A \code{date}. Starting date of the series.}

\item{view}{A \code{boolean}. The default is \code{TRUE}. If set to \code{FALSE}, the results are NOT going to be shown.}

\item{lang}{A \code{character}. The search language. The default is "en" for english, but "pt" for portuguese is also possible.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} that can be interpreted as a \code{data.frame}. The fields are described below.

\tabular{ll}{
 code \tab The code/index of the series within the database \cr
 description \tab The description of the series \cr
 periodicity \tab The periodicity of the series \cr
 start \tab Starting date of the series \cr
 source \tab The source of the series \cr
 unit \tab The unit of measurement of the data
}
}
\description{
Searches the BETS databases for a time series by its description, source, periodicity, code, data, unit of measurement and database name.

\itemize{

\item{ Syntax rules for the parameter \code{description}, the search string to look for matching series descriptions: 
   \enumerate{
       \item{To search for alternative words, separate them by white spaces. 
             Example: \code{description = "ipca core"} means that the series description must contain 'ipca' AND'core'
       }
       \item{To search for whole expressions, surround them with \code{' '}.
             Example: \code{description = "'core ipca' index"} means that the series description must contain 'core ipca' AND 'index'
       }
       \item{To exclude words from the search, insert a \code{~} before each of them.
             Example: \code{description = "ipca ~ core"} means that the series description must contain 'ipca' AND must NOT contain 'core'
       }
       \item{To exclude whole expressions from the search, surround them with code{' '} and insert a \code{~} before each of them.
             Example: \code{description = "~ 'ipca core' index"} means that the series description must contain 'index' AND must NOT contain 'core ipca'
       }
       \item{It is possible to search for multiple words or expressions and to negate multiple words or expressions, as long as the preceeding rules are observed. 
       }
       \item{The white space after the negation sign (\code{~}) is not required. But the white spaces AFTER expressions or words ARE required.
       }
