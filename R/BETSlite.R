#' @title BETS: A package for obtaining and analysing thousands of Brazilian economic time series.
#'
#' @description The Brazilian Economic Time Series lite (BETSlite) package provides access and
#'information about the most important Brazilian economic time series.
#'
#'These series are created by three influential centers: the Central Bank of 
#'Brazil (BCB), the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) 
#'and the Brazilian Institute of Economics, from the Getulio Vargas Foundation
#'(FVG-IBRE). Currently, there are more than 18.640 available time series, most
#'of them free of charge. Besides providing access to this vast database, the
#'package allows the user to interact with data in an easy and friendly way. 
#'
#' @note The authors would like to thank the support by the Getulio 
#' Vargas Foundation (FGV) and make it clear that all 
#' data in the package is in public domain. The rights of all centers from 
#' which the series are taken are maintained. We reaffirm that BETS
#' is mainly intended for academic usage.
